# DESCRIPTION:-
Internship Task–1: API Integration and Data Visualization Using Python

This internship task focuses on building practical skills in API integration, data handling, and data visualization using Python. The objective is to fetch real-time or live data from a public API—such as OpenWeatherMap—process the received data, and present meaningful insights through graphical visualizations. The entire task is to be implemented and executed using Visual Studio Code, ensuring hands-on experience with a professional development environment.
The task begins with understanding how public APIs work. An API (Application Programming Interface) allows applications to communicate with external services. In this task, Python is used to send HTTP requests to a public API endpoint, authenticate using an API key, and receive structured data, usually in JSON format. For example, weather APIs provide information such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, atmospheric pressure, and weather conditions for a given city or geographic location. Learning to interpret this raw API response is a key part of the task.
Once the data is fetched, the next step is data extraction and preprocessing. The API response often contains more information than required, so relevant fields must be selected and cleaned. This step helps interns understand how real-world data is rarely ready for direct use and often requires filtering, transformation, and formatting before analysis. Python libraries such as requests are used for API calls, while basic data structures like dictionaries and lists help organize the extracted values.
The core learning outcome of this task lies in data visualization. After processing the data, visualization libraries such as Matplotlib or Seaborn are used to create charts and graphs. These visualizations may include line graphs to show temperature changes over time, bar charts comparing weather parameters, or pie charts representing weather conditions. Visualization makes complex data easy to understand and helps in identifying patterns and trends quickly. This step also introduces interns to best practices in labeling axes, adding titles, legends, and improving visual clarity.
As part of the deliverable, interns must submit:
A Python script that demonstrates API integration, data processing, and visualization.
A visualization dashboard, which may consist of one or more well-structured plots displayed together to represent the fetched data clearly.
Using VS Code ensures familiarity with running Python scripts, managing files, handling errors, and organizing code efficiently. The task encourages clean coding practices, proper comments, and modular structure.
Overall, this internship task provides real-world exposure to how software applications interact with live data sources and how raw data can be transformed into meaningful visual insights. Successfully completing this task strengthens fundamental skills in Python programming, API usage, and data visualization—essential competencies for careers in data science, software development, and analytics. Completion of this task contributes toward earning the internship completion certificate at the end of the internship period.Internship Task–1: API Integration and Data Visualization Using Python
